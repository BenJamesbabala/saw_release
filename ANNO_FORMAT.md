## JSON Data Format

The data format of the original Intrinsic Images in the Wild is extended
with the new type of annotations in SAW. Each photo is indexed by its OpenSurfaces ID,
stored in `saw/saw_images_512/[id].png` and
`saw/saw_annotations_json/[id].json`.

Below is an example judgements JSON file with comments:

```
